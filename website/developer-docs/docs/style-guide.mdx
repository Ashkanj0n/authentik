title: Style Guide
---

Here are a few guidelines to ensure that the documentation is easy to read and uses similar phrasing. Remember to use our [templates](/templates) when possible; they are already set up to follow may of the style guidelines below.

If you find any documentation that doesn't match these guidelines, feel free to either open an [Issue](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/issues) or a [PR](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/pulls) so they can be fixed.

To test how the documentation renders use the Netlify Deploy Preview, especially when using Docusaurus-specific features. Or [build it locally and test](./writing-documentation.md#setup-your-local-build), using the `make website-watch` command.

You can use standard [Docusaurus-specific features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features), which include MDX elements such as tabs and admonitions.

## Terminology

### authentik names

-   The product name authentik should always be stylized as `authentik` (with a lower-case "a" and ending with a "k").

- Our company name is Authentik Security, Inc. but in non-legal docs you can shorten it to Authentik Security.

### Industry terms, technology, and other tools

-   When referring to external tools, or an industry term or technology, always follow the exact capitalization that the product or company itself uses, or what the industry uses in consensus.

## Writing style

-   authentik documentation strives for a friendly, but not overly so, tone. It's ok to be a little bit conversational, and to address the reader in second person: "Next, you need to configure the login settings."

-   Our documentation uses American English ("z" not "s").

-   Phrasing should almost always be in present tense and active voice:

    -   DON'T: "The Applications page will be loaded."

    -   DO: "The Applications page displays."

-   Phrasing should never blame the user, and should be subjective:

    -   DON'T: "Never modify the default file."

    -   DO: "We recommend not modifying the default file."

-   Use abbreviations where it makes sense (for commonly used terms like SAML and OAuth) for common terms. If an abbreciation is less-known, spell it out in parentheses after the first use.

## Formatting

Formatting in documentation is important; it improves readability, and allows the brain to more quickly determine what is a command or a configuration setting, what is a field name, or

-   When referring to UI elements or components in the authentik UI, such as field names, labels, etc., use **bold** text.

-   For variables or placeholders, use angle brackets and italicize the text inside the brackets, to indicate that it is a variable (`_<placeholder-name>_`). Make sure to specify if the placeholder is something the user needs to define, is something another system defines, or is generated.

-   When referring to authentik functionality and features, such as flows, stages, sources, or policies, do not cappitalize and do not use bold or italic text. When possible link to the corresponding documentation.

### Titles and headers

-   Both titles and headers (H1, H2, H3) use sentence style capitalization, meaning that only the first word is capitalized.

    -   If the title or header includes a proper noun (name of a product, etc) then capitalize those words.
